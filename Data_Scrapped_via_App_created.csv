So clearly his fault.Since then it has been a nightmare. The claim was first passed to One Call claims handling - a separate company - and then as I wanted my car to be repaired by the main dealer (although I have no idea why this should be an issue) it had to be passed onto Easidrive claims handlers instead. They are only interested in giving me a hire car and even though the main dealer will give me one for free, that is not an option apparently. The other option was to have my car taken to somewhere hundreds of miles away for repair, which I was not happy with. I am having to chase constantly for updates, although there are none as nothing is happening and the other parties insurers don't seem to want to agree to the repairs for some reason. It is a nightmare getting hold of anyone, but if they want to call you they ring continuously, which is very annoying as I cannot usually take calls during the day, being a teacher.Similar issues with getting Physio, they call you constantly too and then when I managed to speak to them, they had booked me in a place in Manchester and I live in Bedfordshire 2 hours away. Regardless of cost I will be moving to another insurers when this claim is finally settled.

I immediately forwarded it to One call, all this on the 12th of Jan 2024, (2days after the policy started).On the 15th of Jan I received an email from One Call, confirming that it had received and accepted proof of my NCB.Today I received yet another demand for the proof and a threat to cancel my policy, if I did not send the documents that it had already received and accepted.I was livid with its treatment of me and its ineptitude, so I tried to contact it by email. I logged in and tried ""contact us"" : I was taken round and round in ever decreasing circles, until I finally gave up and tried ""complaints"". Guess what, it had an ever increasing circle program, which, if I chose to, led me to the ""contact us"" program.I'm 80 soon and the last car insurance claim I made was in Kenya over 50 years ago. I have driven vehicles in this country since 1961 and have not made a claim.

www.onecallinsurance.co.uk,2024-01-20T22:02:15.000Z,I Believe This Company Owes Me Money,"I payed for one years car insurance on 14th May 2023. I changed my car 11th December 2023. I rang One Call expecting to pay a fee. However I am told I had to take out a new policy - something I have never experienced in 47 years! I asked how much a new policy was and was shocked by the price (Over £300 more than anyone else!) I asked for a part refund on my old policy as it is paid up until 14th May 2024. I am told there is no refund whatsoever. I argue what is the point of paying insurance a year in advance if you cant change your car? I have sent two letters to this company - the last one recorded delivery so I know they have received my complaint. I am still waiting for a reply. I feel completely conned and ignored. I believe they have received 5 months Insurance Premiums - payed in advance -  which they say is not returnable. My advice to anyone thinking of using this company is don't!  Or if you do, pay by Monthly Direct Debit!

However eventually managed to ‘speak’ via online chat and whilst this can be a tortuous process as the conversation has to obviously be typed the customer service agent jm3 was great and I ended up with a fantastic renewal price which was unbeatable.

Tried to get a reduction as price had increased so much. Was given a princely refund of £2.73 for half an hour of my time. I’ve learnt my lesson. When my car insurance is next due I will be going elsewhere. I’m not a happy bunny!!Following the above review I received a telephone call from One Call. I had high hopes! The caller, Charlotte, confirmed that a refund of £2.73 was correct but I had the option of cancelling my policy and receiving a full refund. As I was away from home, without any paperwork or access to good Wi-Fi, and as there was less than 48 hours to take up cheaper quotes I was stuck. Can’t understand why I was called just to have my refund of £2.73 confirmed? Another waste of my time. Cheers! Off to buy a loaf of bread!

Only way of contact is through an online chat feature which is slow and very unreliable. I tried contacting them through the online chat to cancel my policy, after waiting a long time in the queue to speak to someone and eventually being connected, half way through the conversation, the chat crashed and abrubtly ended. I assumed I would need to try again when I had more time to proceed with making my cancellation request. A week later I receive a text message and an email from Onecall threatening to pass my details over to debt collection. At first I assumed it was a typical scam message so I thought I would do my due diligence and investigate. Check my emails/messages including spam folders and can not see that I have had ANY contact from them. Log into my online account and sure enough I can see the policy has indeed been cancelled, but nothing about an outstanding balance. I join the queue to connect with a member of staff through the online chat feature again to find out the policy had been cancelled, and that I owed a fee. Disgusted that I received no confirmation of the policy being cancelled, or ANY notification of outstanding balances before receiving threats of debt collection. Based on this experience I would not recommend and would never use them again.

www.onecallinsurance.co.uk,2024-01-12T19:04:29.000Z,Terrible company who do not care about you…,"I was with One call for a fair few years paying for the Platinum package. One call were happy to take my money every month as all insurance companies do. Then May 2023 I had an accident on a round about with a pick up truck crashed into my passenger side bumper. I was on the right hand side in the feeder lane going into one, the other driver did not like the fact I was going past to go in front! he proceeded to speed up and took my bumper off!Everything was good at the start  was recovered and taken home, Hire car delivered the next day and my car collected and taken for repair a few days later.Then things turned sour when One call arranged for the hire car to be returned so I could have a courtesy car delivered. This seemed OK until NO car arrived and I lost out on earnings for 4 days as I had no car!!Fast forward January 2024 and I have been informed due to dash cam footage on the other vehicle they accepted liability, so I lose £200! How can they accept liability when it clearly shows the other driver crashing into me! I spoke on line as usual as one call are absolutely garbage in allowing you to speak to a human!  biggest let down is you never speak to anyone in person! I am now still chasing my loss of earnings claim, I will not hold my breathe in getting any money.In a nutshell, really terrible after service and do not care about you, their customers are just numbers who they are happy to take money off!

I downloaded my policy documents from the brokers website ""One call"" website and the new underwriter they never told me about as it was on auto renew was Royal Sun Alliance, the policy document clearly stated I was covered for accidental damage and TV's were covered. One call who never takes calls and there is no option to have a live chat unless you put in a claim said I need to speak to the broker why I wasn't covered, claims dept have nothing to do with the brokers although they are under the same umbrella and building, after numerous annoying calls, not just one call, I was told by the broker they don't have anything to do with it and to speak to claims, clearly passing the buck. I eventually got through to a manager who was equally dense who confirmed I was covered by RSA but I didn't request the extra accidental cover. Total contridiction. I said to the Manager of one call arnt you supposed to sort that out or why are you a broker, so the broker sorts out the contract which is confirmed in writing and paid for but when it comes to making a claim years down the line they say I should have taken out the additional accidental damage direct with the underwriter RSA! I have never known anything so stupid and corrupt! One call will make up the most stupid corrupt excuses to get out of paying.

www.onecallinsurance.co.uk,2024-01-11T15:00:31.000Z,Avoid one call at all costs. A waste of money,"I noticed a leaking roof on 26/12 from the storm hit the northeast in 22-24/12. I pay for a home insurance, emergency cover and accidental cover with OneCall (policy OCI001/AD/000028410 ) . I called them on the 28/12, to be told that my emergency cover does not cover this storm as the winds speeds recorded in my area (not being told how exactly it was calculated), is not classed as a storm as it is at 53 mph which is below the 55mph stipulated in my insurance schedule (how convenient).So I was told to contact the basic home insurance (the underwriter -Arkel), I contacted Arkel on 28/12 and I was told I will be contacted about this in due time. When nothing happened for a whole week, I called them again on 06/01/24 the underwriter sent an email 08/01/24 initially requesting for a damage report, and photos of the damage, and previous insurance details, which I supplied promptly, 2 days later they returned with an elusive email, that I don’t have accidental cover, but when I showed that I do, and sent the schedule, they back tracked and said it doesn’t cover walls, only covers glass, they came with another answer, that the roofer report doesn’t say anything about a storm damage, which I challenged, but eventually told to either cancel the claim, get a formal repudiation or find my building guarantee to cover it instead, … DO NOT take insurance with ONE CALL, an absolute waste of money, I am absolutely disgusted at their customer service, the unprofessional and bad-mannered customers service (every time I call for any explanation, dialing the number given on the email, the person claims they are not the claim handler, although they confirm that they who have sent the email, and the claim handler is indisposed and as soon as I send an email with some query or response, I get an immediate response from the claim handler. This ordeal has been going on for almost 15 days going no where. ! (claim CPA196666), The other interesting thing I was told that the quote provided does not allow for reinstatement like for like but for amendments as a result of it not being fit for purpose! Am I supposed to repair the roof with half-way temporary measures in order to qualify for insurance? Instead of getting a rubber roofing that will stop the problem completely??I am glad i have some silicone to patch up the damage and to stop the ingress of more water.Honestly, it is a nightmare I don’t wish on anyone, trying to claim for a genuine problem and your insurance lets you down for “technicalities”. Using OneCall for insurance is money down the drain, you might as well don’t get an insurance, because they will do anything and everything, just not to pay.",Haitham Khashaba,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/500aabfb00006400011db343/,1

After the shock I looked into the batter for my car which cost me £55 pounds and took me five minutes to change. The sensor cost £8 and again I did it myself which took fifteen minutes.  I'm now looking to move to a more ethical company.,Mark Shearman,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/65b0e51cdfad7e0012dd6a88/,1

I was in the middle of a call with the RAC when a RAC van stopped behind me to see if we were ok.  At that time the engineer had no idea whether I was with the RAC or not.

Apparently there is a 7 day period on new policies and renewals, where the RAC will not replace batteries, which I was completely unaware of.

www.rac.co.uk,2024-01-22T21:51:33.000Z,2 cars - 2 policies - 2 breakdowns - At The Same Time,"We’ve had RAC cover on our cars over 9 years and we’ve had only one call out to date - 5 years ago.  Today, We have had an utter day of hell !!  The worst weather day of the year - (Storm Isha) At 7am, a crunching noise from the front left side of our Jaguar.  I told my partner NOT to drive the car and telephoned the RAC.  Being a hugely bad weather day, we exercised common sense and expected a longer response time.  That said, the RAC provided a regular text message update.  At 09:20, “Paul” arrived and swiftly diagnosed a snapped suspension coil spring.  He simply asked us where would we want our car recovered to . . . In summary the car was perfectly recovered to our chosen garage.  An excellent recovery time from first contact to completion . . . . AND THEN . . . . At 3pm, driving our other car, it decided to light the dashboard with “STOP - ENGINE FAILURE ” !!  ( RENAULT ) .   I couldn’t believe it.  No calls in 5 years and now two in one day !!!  2 cars - 2 separate cover policies.  Thankfully I had arrived at work at this time.  I contacted the RAC again and stated the situation.  I did lessen the urgency of time to attend as being fair to the RAC on a hugely bad weather day, I respected that there were more urgent cases to deal with.  I informed them of this.  The RAC again kept me well informed as to when they would arrive.  This time, it was “Thomas” who arrived.   Thomas was utterly brilliant, the wind howling, the rain lashing down.  I think I made his day by getting our Renault undercover in a well lit heated building owned by my employer.   Thomas was incredible thorough and even had the car raised to discover the EXACT problem.  A particular non common part was needed.  The repair couldn’t be completed there and then.  Thomas offered to recover the car to a chosen garage.  I spoke to a mobile mechanic who stated that they could fit the part on site.  I declined the recovery option.  Thomas was, again superb. I would recommend RAC 1000% . . . They may be a bit more expensive than some you see online but I believe you get what you pay for.

Called out rac as my friends car who I was driving broke down, informed them of her policy on the vehicle and my separate one too. Came out and messed around with the car, decided it was the head gasket just going so he put sealant in it and told me to ring him ON HIS MOBILE NUMBER if we broke down. Got back to my friends work (whose car it was) after she spoke on the phone with you guys again, and sorted out getting it towed back home. After 3 hours of waiting again, we received a call from the technician (this time not off the mobile number) informing us that they where refusing service as we where advised NOT to drive on the breakdown sheet and we did.We were never advised not to drive, and we also never received a breakdown sheet advising us not too. He put sealant in the vehicle so we could drive it back… if we were advised NOT to drive why would he have done this? We waited for 3 hours to be eventually told No! We were stuck in Asda carpark at 10pm and had to pay £165 to get towed home by an alternate service. This was absolutely shocking service and I want my money back for towing the vehicle home! I also want a full refund of the services as clearly didn’t need it! The rac man also broke the coolant cap which is now stuck in the vehicle!!!!EDIT FOR THE RAC REPLYI have already made the complaint (UF128039809)Been told today that they’re unable to take the complaint further as we were advised not to drive! This is not true at all, I also never even received the breakdown report to tell me this. The service man rung us off his mobile, and told us after putting sealant in to call him if we had an issues! Is this not a violation of privacy in itself? Your rubbish company cost me 8 hours of my day and £165. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE, you may as well push your own car home!Update 2:Been FINALLY sent the breakdown report and they forged my signature! I never signed the document whatsoever or even read it.

I was assured by email that I would be reimbursed if I provided a payment receipt. I did exactly that after I received the fine only to be later told they wouldn't cover the cost. Disappointed is an understatement!! Their customer service was very poor and unhelpful!. I was actually deceived into paying the fine. I emailed back several times on this and I've just been ignored!

This happened during the early stages of the pandemic. So the car was SORN, the insurance and RAC cover maintained including battery cover. So 2.5 years on his licence has now been officially removed. The car has not been driven during this time as he is a very possessive man and would get upset if anyone else drove it. The time has come to sell it, so I contacted the RAC asking for home start for the battery. The service and response was beyond pathetic. I dealt with an individual whose grasp of the English language was horrific, would only read from a script in a very metronomic way and would offer no solutions on explaining the situation about dementia and could not grasp what SORN is even after a full explanation. I asked for a superior but she refused at first but when I said I was recording this conversation she then went to get a superior. The supervisor took the phone and went hello hello and cut me off. Easily the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The RAC should be ashamed. Even their own complaint line is closed. That says something about them as an organisation.

www.rac.co.uk,2024-01-19T18:52:21.000Z,Phoning the RAC in an emergency is not easy.,"Phoning the RAC breakdown and accident helpline number (0333 2000 999) is not easy because you have to go through three sets of options before you reach a real person.  Firstly, a taped voice asks whether you have RAC cover already or whether you are a non-member wanting to buy cover.  Well, it's a breakdown number - surely non-members should call the sales number?  Why delay the response to an emergency call?  Secondly, a tape asks whether it's a new breakdown or one you've reported already and  advises you to report it online or via the RAC app.  Hmm, why would I be phoning if I could do that?  Thirdly, you press one to speak to someone but before that there's a taped warning about aggressive behaviour towards the RAC staff.  This suggests to me that many people get angry with the RAC phone response, which I can understand after that runaround of options and taped voices plus ID checks on you and your car.  I cancelled my request for breakdown help because a bored-sounding person told it would take at least two hours and it could be longer - my call was 'in the system', so she said, with no specific or estimated time at which help might arrive.  This isn't user-friendly or convenient at a stressful time.  If you don't have a smartphone and you're away from internet access, the RAC is not for you.  I don't know how other breakdown services work and I don't know when RAC help might have arrived, but my recent experience was disappointing.  The adverts offer peace of mind but that's not my feeling now.",john ,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5665b5280000ff0001f10979/,1

Don't think about buying their breakdown service unless you live in a city preferably not in the southwest. They pay appalling rates to their contractors and so no one takes work from them in the south west. Total waste of money and downright dangerous.

I cancelled the service this evening yet I still seem to be getting texts.

However, when I called to discuss this with another member of the sales team, he reassured me all was well and we ran through the criteria that would make me need business insurance-surprise, surprise, I had none of them.The second salesman call was after this, basically accusing his helpful colleague of being a liar and saying I need to upgrade. So, I cancelled-someone’s lying, but I suspect it’s not the very helpful chap I spoke to on Tuesday, but the other two oiks that clearly have sales targets to meet and have chosen to do so unethically.I spent three times more for the same level of cover with the AA, but at least they were happy to confirm in writing that I am covered…worth it.",Bethany Windsor,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f5f5a8fd53200a35ac5f170/,1

From then they were starting give me the fake promises and fake delivery date. When ever I contact the customer care they car are telling that i will be getting a call back from the logistics team because they are handling the delivery's and i don’t even get a call from them. From Monday they postponed the delivery to Wednesday and I waited till night to get an  updation and around 8pm when i ring them they told me that my delivery has postponed to Friday on Thursday when i ring the customer care they told that i will be getting a call from there escalation team and a lady called me back from the escalation team and she was not even interested in answering the question i asked her regarding the date of delivery and she was repeating that my car will be delivering on Friday and she shouted towards me and she cut the call and left. And I waited till midnight on Friday 12/01/2024 for an updation and nothing happened and on Sunday when i again ring RAC and raised the issues i got a call from RAC asking some apologies on delay and told they have assigned the delivery job to one of there agent and they will be collecting the car on Monday (15/01/2024)from them and and they will be delivering on the same day. On monday when I emailed to the logistics team they told me that they postponed the delivery to Tuesday due to the sickness of the  delivery driver and again they postponed the delivery date from Tuesday to Wednesday, and finally yesterday(17/01/2024)they delivered the car.They took 21 days to deliver my car after the breakdown and I received the worst customer care service of my life from the RAC and i have never seen such irresponsible people telling with lies and giving fake dates and promises.

My wife broke down yesterday on a busy bridge in -4 temperatures, called for assistance and it turns out my tax has expired - having not recieved any reminders, I contacted the DVLA who then told me I wasn’t registered as the owner of the vehicle - this was an error from the dealership who hadn’t submitted the right paperwork. I’m an honest person and I drive for a well known company so I have every reason to tax my car, this was a mistake and the RAC made me feel like a criminal and left my wife stranded in the cold on a busy road for 4 hours, in the mean time I managed to get the car taxed through the dealership and the RAC still wouldn’t come and help, even though I’ve paid for a membership for easily over 5 years, disgusting service, couldn’t even offer any other help, just left her stuck in the road in the cold, won’t ever use yourselves again, regardless of the t’s and c’s the car was taxed in the end and you still wouldn’t do anything.

The policy ended December and they auto renewed taken £40 plus out of my account and the same in January 3 days ago I spotted this and called them they said they had sent a letter by post which I never received they also said they had senran email and I have checked my emails and there are none saying about a renewal price so I cancelled and they are returning nearly all of the January direct debit but not all and they have kept December I feel like I have been robbed and by the way checked out their web site full cover is £17 a month so why £40 plus beware large direct debits never agreed,Richard Shiels,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/4d9115580000640001077ce4/,1

www.rac.co.uk,2024-01-17T19:43:14.000Z,"RAC declined to attend a breakdown on country road, involving a lone, pregnant female.","I broke down on a country road, just before some temporary traffic lights, on Wednesday 10th January at approximately 5.30pm. I was a lone, pregnant, female with a 2 year old daughter in nursery. My husband was in Sweden at the time and no family nearby. I called the RAC asking for assistance but they stated I needed to notify the police first to make the area safe before they would attend. I acted on this immediately and called them back to say the police were on their way and to again ask for breakdown assistance. They reported they could not come out as I was broken down in a ‘live lane’ (a country road) and needed to be towed to somewhere safe first before they could attend, as it was ‘too dangerous for their men’. I queried this as I was under the impression breakdown companies are able to tow cars to a safe location, as this is a service we have paid for in our policy. They again stated it was too dangerous for them to come out. This left me with no option but to use another tow company, which subsequently charged me £250. Totally unacceptable and I have lost complete trust in any security that the RAC state they provide in a situation such as mine (I.e. a relatively normal breakdown occurrence). Having spoken to others who have broken down in much more dangerous situations (e.g. on a roundabout in rush hour), it seems this is strange as they have been attended to by the AA straight away with no problems. I submitted a formal complaint to the RAC via their website, asking for resolution of this and a refund of the cost of having to use a private tow company. They were unwilling to discuss / provide any compensation for such a poor service and closed the complaint. We have now made a follow up complaint. It was a very stressful situation for me, being pregnant and alone in the dark on a country road, with no family nearby, and the RAC declined to help in any way, despite having breakdown cover with them.
